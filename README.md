# Heart Disease Prediction using KNN 🚑

This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to predict whether a person has heart disease based on a set of health-related features. The dataset contains information about various medical characteristics, and the goal is to predict whether a person has heart disease. This is implemented in R using the `class` library for KNN classification.

## Introduction 🌟

The purpose of this project is to classify whether a person is at risk of having heart disease using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset used contains several medical features such as age, cholesterol levels, and more. The goal is to classify individuals into two groups: **Heart Disease** or **No Heart Disease**.

The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, it showcases the use of KNN to predict the likelihood of heart disease for new patients.

## Code Explanation 📝

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is first cleaned by removing any missing values. Then, the data is scaled using Min-Max scaling to bring all the features within the same range.
  
- **KNN Model**: The KNN algorithm is used to predict the target variable (`heart disease` or `no heart disease`). We use the `knn()` function from the `class` library to perform classification.

- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated by calculating the accuracy based on the confusion matrix (`TC`). We also experimented with different values of `k` to find the best performing value.

- **Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict whether Meeee : XD **Yassmine Yazidi** has heart disease or not based on her medical data.


**Enjoy using the Heart Disease Prediction model!** 😃
